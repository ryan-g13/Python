'''Exercise 7
Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
'''

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
'''
b = []

for i in a:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        b.append(i)

print(b)
'''
b = [i for i in a if i % 2 == 0] #single line version of the above for loop checking for evens, also learned to add if statements to single lines
print(b)
